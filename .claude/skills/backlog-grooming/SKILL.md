# Backlog Grooming

Systematically review recent work, close resolved issues, identify gaps, and maintain a clean issue backlog.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Progress Tracking

Create a dated progress file:
```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
PROGRESS_FILE="plan/${DATE}_BACKLOG_GROOMING.md"
```

### Step 2: Fetch and Analyze Recent PRs

```bash
gh pr list --state merged --limit 15 --json number,title,mergedAt,body,url
```

For each PR, extract:
- Issues referenced (closes #N, fixes #N, resolves #N)
- Work done (features, fixes, refactors)
- Gaps (work done without corresponding issues)

### Step 3: Verify Issue Resolution

For each issue referenced in PRs:
```bash
gh issue view 123 --json state,title,labels
```

Decision matrix:
- **Fully resolved** -> Close with comment referencing PR
- **Partially resolved** -> Update with progress comment
- **Not resolved** -> Keep open, remove incorrect PR reference
- **Spawned new work** -> Create follow-up issue, close original

### Step 4: Close Resolved Issues

```bash
gh issue close 123 --comment "Resolved in PR #456. [Description of fix]. Changes: [list]. Closes via: [PR URL]"
```

### Step 5: Check for Duplicates Before Creating New Issues

```bash
gh issue list --search "keyword" --state all
gh issue list --label "bug" --state open
```

### Step 6: Create Missing Issues

For gaps identified (features, bugs fixed, follow-up work) that have no existing issue:
```bash
gh issue create --title "Issue title" --body "Description" --label "label1,label2"
```

### Step 7: Finalize Progress File

Complete the summary with statistics: PRs analyzed, issues closed, issues created, issues updated, backlog health before/after.

## Examples

See `references/templates.md` for issue close/create templates and `references/example-session.md` for a complete grooming session walkthrough.

### Example 1: Closing a Resolved Issue

```bash
gh issue close 123 --comment "Resolved in PR #456

Added input validation for single-object payloads.

Changes:
- Added type check in process_input()
- Added test for single-object case

Thank you for reporting! Fix is merged and available."
```

### Example 2: Creating a Follow-Up Issue

```bash
gh issue create --title "perf: Optimize database queries in user search" \
  --body "During PR #458, identified N+1 query in user search. Need to add eager loading." \
  --label "enhancement,performance"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Too many PRs to review
- Focus on most recent PRs first
- Split into multiple sessions, document stopping point
- Default to last 15 PRs unless specified otherwise

### Error: Can't find issues referenced in PR
- Check PR body AND individual commit messages
- Look for variations: "close", "fix", "resolve" (with/without #)
- If genuinely missing, create retrospective issue

### Error: Found many duplicate issues
- Consolidate into a canonical issue
- Close duplicates with link to canonical
- Consider improving issue labels/search to prevent future duplicates
