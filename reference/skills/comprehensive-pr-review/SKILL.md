# Comprehensive PR Review

Structured code review evaluating PRs across security, quality, testing, documentation, and project compliance.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Summarize the PR
Brief overview of what the PR does (2-3 sentences).

### Step 2: Identify Strengths
What is done well: good design decisions, well-written code, comprehensive tests, clear documentation, proper error handling.

### Step 3: Security Review
Flag security issues with severity:
- **BLOCKING**: Must fix before merge (injection, auth bypass, secrets exposure)
- **HIGH**: Should fix soon (missing input validation, weak crypto)
- **LOW**: Nice to have (hardening, defense-in-depth)

### Step 4: Identify Problems
Critical issues blocking merge: bugs, incorrect logic, failing tests, missing required features.

### Step 5: Evaluate Code Quality
Non-blocking improvements: readability, naming, organization, complexity.

### Step 6: Check Project Compliance
Verify against project standards (adjust to project's CLAUDE.md):
- Test coverage meets threshold
- Docstring coverage meets threshold
- Linting rules pass
- Type checking passes
- No forbidden patterns
- Conventional commits used

### Step 7: Assess Testing
- Test coverage adequate?
- Edge cases covered?
- Integration tests included?

### Step 8: Review Documentation
- Docstrings complete?
- README updated if needed?
- Examples provided for new APIs?

### Step 9: List Requests
Medium-priority suggestions that would improve the PR.

### Step 10: Deliver Verdict
- **LGTM** - Ready to merge
- **CHANGES_REQUESTED** - Must fix blocking issues
- **COMMENTS** - Suggestions only, can merge as-is

Include reasoning with specific file:line references.

## Examples

### Example 1: Approval with Suggestions

```markdown
## Summary
Adds user search endpoint with partial name/email matching.

## Strengths
- Clean separation of concerns (router -> service -> repository)
- Parameterized SQL queries prevent injection
- Good test coverage (94%)

## Security Concerns
None identified.

## Problems
None blocking.

## Code Quality
- Consider extracting the search query builder into its own method
- `search_users` could benefit from a `limit` parameter with default

## Verdict: LGTM
Well-structured PR with good test coverage. Suggestions are non-blocking.
```

### Example 2: Changes Requested

```markdown
## Summary
Adds file upload endpoint for user avatars.

## Security Concerns
- BLOCKING: No file type validation - allows arbitrary file upload (src/api/upload.py:23)
- HIGH: No file size limit - potential DoS vector (src/api/upload.py:15)

## Problems
- Missing error handling for disk full scenario (src/services/storage.py:45)
- Test doesn't verify file content, only status code (tests/test_upload.py:30)

## Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED
Security concerns must be addressed before merge. Add file type whitelist
and size limit validation.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: PR is too large to review effectively
- Ask the author to split into smaller PRs
- Focus on the most critical files first (API surface, security-sensitive code)
- Use `gh pr diff --name-only` to prioritize which files to review

### Error: Unclear what the PR is supposed to do
- Check for linked issues or a description
- Ask the author to add context before reviewing
- Review the test names - they often describe intended behavior
