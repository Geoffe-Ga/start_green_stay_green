# Bug Squashing Methodology

Systematic process for fixing bugs: Document, Understand, Fix, Verify. Never skip straight to coding.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Create `RCA_ISSUE_XXX.md` with:
- **Problem Statement**: Error message, reproduction steps
- **Root Cause**: Exact line/logic causing failure
- **Analysis**: Why it happens, what was confused/wrong
- **Impact**: Severity, scope, frequency
- **Contributing Factors**: Why wasn't it caught earlier?
- **Fix Strategy**: Options with recommendation
- **Prevention**: How to avoid similar bugs

### Step 2: File a GitHub Issue

```bash
gh issue create --title "bug(component): Brief description" \
  --body "Reproduction steps, root cause summary, proposed fix" \
  --label "bug"
```

### Step 3: Branch and Fix with TDD

```bash
git checkout -b fix-component-issue-XXX
```

1. **Red**: Write a test that reproduces the bug (should fail)
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to fix the bug (test passes)
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the fix while keeping tests green

### Step 4: Quality Gates

Run both gates before committing:

```bash
# Gate 1: All tests pass
./scripts/test.sh --all

# Gate 2: All quality checks pass
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Step 5: Commit and PR

Use conventional commit format: `fix(component): brief description (#XXX)`

Include in commit body:
- Problem description (reference RCA)
- Solution description
- Specific file changes
- Testing confirmation (both gates green)

## Examples

### Example 1: Type Validation Bug

**Problem**: API endpoint crashes when receiving single object instead of list.

**RCA**: `src/services/business_logic.py:45` assumes input is always a list. Missing type validation causes runtime error.

**Fix**:
```python
# Red: Write test reproducing the bug
def test_process_handles_single_object():
    result = process_input({"key": "value"})  # Single object, not list
    assert result == [{"key": "value"}]

# Green: Fix the code
def process_input(data):
    if isinstance(data, dict):
        data = [data]
    return [transform(item) for item in data]
```

### Example 2: Off-by-One Boundary Error

**Problem**: Pagination returns duplicate items on page boundaries.

**RCA**: `offset = page * limit` should be `offset = (page - 1) * limit` since pages are 1-indexed.

**Fix**:
```python
# Red: Test that reproduces duplicate
def test_pagination_no_duplicates():
    page1 = get_items(page=1, limit=10)
    page2 = get_items(page=2, limit=10)
    assert not set(page1) & set(page2)  # No overlap

# Green: Fix offset calculation
def get_items(page: int, limit: int):
    offset = (page - 1) * limit  # Fixed: was page * limit
    return db.query(Item).offset(offset).limit(limit).all()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Can't reproduce the bug locally
- Check environment differences (Python version, OS, dependencies)
- Add debug logging at the failure point
- Try running with the exact same data/input as the report

### Error: Fix breaks other tests
- Your fix may have changed shared behavior. Check test assumptions.
- Run the full test suite, not just the new test
- Consider if the other tests were relying on buggy behavior

### Error: RCA seems like overkill for a simple bug
- Spend 10 minutes on RCA even for "obvious" bugs - they're rarely obvious
- The documentation prevents recurrence and builds institutional knowledge
- Skip RCA only for true typos (wrong variable name, missing comma)
