# Quality Control Scripts Reference

This directory contains reference implementations of quality control scripts for different programming languages.

## Purpose
These scripts serve as templates for the Scripts Generator (Issue 3.3) to create customized quality control scripts for target repositories.

## Structure
Each language directory contains:
- `lint.sh` - Run all linters
- `format.sh` - Auto-format code
- `test.sh` - Run test suite with coverage
- `security.sh` - Security scanning
- `complexity.sh` - Complexity analysis
- `build.sh` - Build/compile the project
- `clean.sh` - Clean build artifacts

## Usage
These are reference implementations that will be:
1. Copied to target repositories
2. Customized based on project configuration
3. Tuned by AI to match project specifics
