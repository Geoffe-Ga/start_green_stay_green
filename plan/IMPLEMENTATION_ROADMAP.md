## Overview

This document outlines the strategic approach to completing the Start Green Stay Green project. The roadmap is organized into 4 phases, each building on the previous phase's deliverables.

**Project Goal:** Build a meta-tool that generates quality-controlled, AI-ready repositories with enterprise-grade quality controls pre-configured.

**Philosophy:** Maximum Quality Engineering - ship green on all checks with zero outstanding issues.

## Risk Management

### Resolved Risks

#### 1. Mutation Testing (Issue #62) - PARTIALLY MITIGATED
**Original Risk:** Killing 276 mutants might take longer than 1 week.

**Resolution:**
- Most files now pass 80% threshold
- Only cli.py remains (48.9%)
- Detailed improvement plan created
- 3-gate workflow removes mutation from continuous blocking

#### 2. AI Token Costs - MITIGATED
**Resolution:**
- Sonnet used for tuning (cost-efficient)
- Mock responses in tests
- Token usage tracking implemented

#### 3. GitHub Integration Complexity - RESOLVED
**Resolution:**
- GitHubClient fully implemented (808 lines)
- 45 comprehensive tests
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Proper error handling

### Remaining Risks

#### 1. cli.py Mutation Testing
**Risk:** 118 surviving mutants in cli.py

**Mitigation:**
- Detailed 4-phase test implementation plan
- Focus on high-value logic mutations
- Estimated 51 new tests needed

**Contingency:** Accept 75% if 80% proves unreachable within time budget.

#### 2. Time Estimates
**Risk:** Documentation might take longer than estimated.

**Mitigation:**
- P2 issues can be deferred to v1.1
- Core functionality complete

## Appendix: Recent Changes

### Workflow Updates (January 2026)

**3-Gate Workflow System**: The development workflow has been updated from 4 gates to 3 gates:
1. **Gate 1**: Local pre-commit (31 hooks)
2. **Gate 2**: CI pipeline green
3. **Gate 3**: Code review LGTM

**Mutation Testing**: Moved from continuous enforcement to periodic quality check for critical infrastructure. This preserves developer flow state while maintaining test effectiveness for high-risk code.

**Reference**: `reference/workflows/stay-green.md`

### GitHub Integration (January 2026)

**Issue #21 Completed**: Full GitHubClient implementation with:
- 808 lines of production code
- 45 comprehensive tests
- Repository, issue, label, milestone management
- Branch protection configuration
- SPEC.md parsing for issue generation
- Retry logic and secure token handling
